        The Vassar Asian American Studies Working Group is a coalition of students working towards the establishment of a substantive Asian American Studies program that is part of the larger field of critical ethnic studies. We seek to build on the work of past Vassar student activists who have been pushing for the introduction of an Asian American Studies program for over forty years.

				<p>In the spring semester of 2020, Asian Studies Department chair Professor Christopher Bjork approached VASAM with a unique opportunity to contribute to the hiring of a postdoctoral fellow for the fall of 2020. VASAM was a critical part of the hiring process, and eventually Professor Vivian Truong was hired. This fall, she taught Introduction to Asian American Studies, and in the Spring of 2021 she will teach 2 more classes before moving on to Swarthmore College in a tenure track position.</p><img src="media/Vivian%20Truong.png">

                    After the semester delay of his visit, Professor Heinz Insu Fenkl (class of 1982) taught 3 Asian American Studies courses at Vassar in the Spring of 2020. The courses were Transnational Korea, Transnational India, and Asian American Graphic Literature. He provided a lot of insight into the history of Asian American studies at Vassar because he was a student here and taught later on in his life.

                    In the Fall of 2019, Vassar had plans in place for Professor Heinz Insu Fenkl to visit and teach three Asian American courses; however, his visit was pushed back a semester and Vassar was left with no Asian American Studies courses for the semester. In response, members of VASAM organized a student-organized, student-taught course titled Activist Academia: An Asian American Studies Approach to Power Analysis. Different students taught classes in areas of their interest related to Asian American Studies across 8 weeks and the course culminated in an optional final project which was presented at a showcase held in the Rose Parlor.

                <p>Tamika Whitenack, Jonan Kiang, and Nicole Kormendi attended the three-day Association for Asian American Studies conference (AAAS Conference). At the conference, they were able to learn more about the intersectionality and interdisciplinary nature of Asian American studies with other fields like disability studies, environmental studies, and refugee studies. The experience also highlighted the duality of activism in academia in both creating institutional memory while striving to build more inclusive spaces.

The campaign consisted of a series of graphics designed by VASAM members detailing the failure of Vassar to provide a comprehensive Asian American Studies program as well as the motivation for forming and goals of VASAM.
